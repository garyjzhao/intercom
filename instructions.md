Here is the prompt (HTML file attached):


## The Setup


We're going to do a fun exercise with making some improvements to our sandwiches as a service website. For simplicity, you may write the CSS and Javascript directly in the HTML file. We'll assess the readability and simplicity of your solution, in addition to how well it meets the requirements described below.


## The Task


We want to make our pricing information more modern, like the other cool SaaS startups. We want to display our plans horizontally, similar to https://www.intercom.com/pricing or https://slack.com/pricing. We also don't want to show Basic and Gourmet level plans at the same time, we should use a tabbed interface to switch between them. We don't necessarily care about the look and feel, just the layout for now. It should satisfy the following criteria:


## Layout requirements


1. Plan cards should have a 1px solid #333 border
2. Plan cards should show the number of sandwiches per month and the price
3. Plan cards should be center aligned on the page with a 10px margin between them
4. Text in the plan cards should be center aligned
5. Plan cards should be the same height


## Tab requirements


1. Only show Basic or Gourmet plans at once
2. Create tabs to switch between showing Basic or Gourmet plans
3. Tabs should be above the plans



## Bonus challenge

- Disable the "Send me a sandwich!" button until the "I acknowledge" checkbox has been selected. (i.e. don't let the user hit the send button until the box is checked)


Additional Questions

1) What would you do if someone reported a marketing page loaded slowly, even if no code has changed?

2) What are the tradeoffs of working with vanilla JS vs a framework?
